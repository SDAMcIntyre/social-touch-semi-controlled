# A dependency-aware configuration representing a task graph (DAG) for Postprocessing.
# 'depends_on' specifies which tasks must be completed before this one can run.
# Set 'enabled: false' to skip a task and all tasks that depend on it.
# UPDATED: Task keys now correspond directly to Python function names.

parameters:
  # Set to true to run different sessions in parallel, false to run them one by one.
